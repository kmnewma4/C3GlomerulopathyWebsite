			<h3>Diet</h3>
				<p>Many kidney disease patients go on a diet to limit the intake of sodium, protein, and or potassium. One common diet is the low sodium diet. Limiting the sodium intake can help lower blood pressure and decrease
				water retention. Typically, the recommended daily intake for this diet is 1500 milligrams. It can be difficult adjusting to lower sodium foods but do not fret! There are plenty of low sodium
				options of common food staples like spaghetti sauce. Additionally, there are numerous cookbooks and online recipes catered toward those with sodium restrictions.</p>
				<p>In addition to dietary restrictions, C3G patients should not take NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin. C3G patients can take acetaminophen, aka Tylenol, as a pain reliever and fever reducer. Another 
					medication C3G patients can not take are decongestants like Sudafed, Sudafed PE, Suphedrine PE, Preparation H, Afrin, Dristan, and Vicks Sinex.</p>

			<h3>Medication</h3>
				<p>Currently, there is not a cure for C3 Glomeruopathy. However, there are medications that can be used to slow the progression of the disease.
					These include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and complement inhibitors. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs control the 
					immune system to prevent it from further damaging the kidney's glomeruli. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are blood pressure medications used to control high blood pressure and lower the amount of protein
					that is leaked into the urine. Complement inhibitors are still being researched as a possible way to regulate the complement system.</p>
				<p>Medical professionals are actively studying C3G and testing possible treatments for the disease. There are many clinical trials for which C3G patients can apply to for developing treatments.</p>
			<h3>Dialysis and Transplant</h3>
				<p>If kidney function has progessed toward kidney failure, the next step is to go on dialysis. There are two types of dialysis. The first, called haemodialysis, involves the patient's blood being filtered by a machine. Two needles are inserted into 
				the patients arm; one carries the unfiltered blood to the machine and the second carries the clean blood back into the body. The second type of dialysis is called peritoneal dialysis. This procedure uses the
				lining of the abdomen to filter the blood. Using a cathether inserted through the skin of the stomach and into the cavity of the abdomen, fluid is pumped into the body and the waste is drawn out as blood travels through the abdomen's lining.</p>
				<p>Sometimes, kidney function does not improve while using dialysis. In this case, a kidney transplant is needed. If there are not any available living donor matches,
				the patient is put on the transplant list. Dialysis is continued until a kidney becomes available. There are specific restrictions and rules when it comes to transplants. To learn more about the transplant process, see this article from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777#:~:text=A%20kidney%20transplant%20is%20a,just%20below%20the%20rib%20cage.">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p>
