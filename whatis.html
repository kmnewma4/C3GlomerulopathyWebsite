			<h3>What exactly is C3 Glomerulopathy?</h3>
				<p>C3 Glomerulopathy, aka C3G, is a kidney disease that specifically relates to the blood protein Complement 3. C3 is used in the body to assist the immune system in fighting diseases and viruses.
				If the complement system undergoes abnormal activity, C3 can break down and become stuck in the glomeruli that filter the blood. The damage that occurs can have a dominio effect: more kidney damage.
				It has been suggested by medical professionals and patients that C3G may be triggered by an illness like strep throat.</p>
			<h3>The Sub-Cases of C3G</h3>
				<p>C3 Glomerulopathy has 2 sub cases: C3 Glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and Dense Deposit Disease (DDD). The type of C3G can be identified via kidney biopsy. To learn more about kidney biopsies, see the <a href = treatment.html>treatment</a> page.</p>

			<h3>The History of C3G</h3>
				<p>Up until a decade ago, C3 Glomeruopathy was known as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). MPGN was divided into 3 cases with the first and third now being known as C3GN and the second as DDD.</p>
			<h3>How rare is C3 Glomeruopathy?</h3>
				<p>Given that there are roughly 8 billion people living on the planet, roughly 16,000 to 24,000 people are estimated to have C3 Glomerulopathy. Using this ratio, less than a thousand people living
				in the United States may have C3G. Additionally, approximately 200 people in the UK may have C3G.</p>
