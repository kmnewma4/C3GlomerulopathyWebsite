			<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
			<p>While tests on the blood and urine can infer the presence of kidney disease, the only way to accurately diagnosis someone with C3 Glomerulopathy is by doing a kidney biopsy.</p>
			<h3>What is a kidney biopsy?</h3>
			<p>In this procedure, a doctor or medical professional will insert a needle through the back and into a kidney and remove one or more pieces of tissue. These pieces are then taken to a lab where they are looked at under an electron microscope.
				Depending on the location and pattern of the C3 in the glomeruli, C3 Glomerulonephritis or Dense Deposit Disease can be diagnosed.</p>
			<p>The specifics of a biopsy depend on the medical professional and the patient. See your doctor for restrictions and advice regarding your biopsy.</p>
