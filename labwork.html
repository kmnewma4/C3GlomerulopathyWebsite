			<h2>Blood Test</h2>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Test</th>
					<th>Normal Range (for adults)</th>
					<th>Abnormal (for adults)</th>
					<th>Conclusion</th>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Urea Nitrogen (Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN))</td>
					<td>6-24 mg/dL</td>
					<td>>24 mg/dL</td>
					<td>Urea is a waste that the kidneys are supposed to filter out of the blood. A high level means that you kidneys aren't working properly.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Creatinine</td>
					<td>Men: 0.7-1.3 mg/dL Women: 0.6-1.1 mg/dL</td>
					<td>>1.3 or 1.1 mg/dL</td>
					<td>Creatinine, a waste created from creatine, must be removed entirely from the blood. A high level means that you kidneys aren't working properly.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>BUN/Creatinine Ratio</td>
					<td>10:1-20:1</td>
					<td>>20:1</td>
					<td>See previous two rows.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Albumin</td>
					<td>3.4-5.4 g/dL</td>
					<td>&lt;3.4 g/dL</td>
					<td>Albumin, created by the liver, contains important hormones, enzymes, and medications used in regulating the body. 
					If the kidney's aren't working properly, albumin is partially removed from the blood and is added to the urine.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Calcium (aka serum calcium)</td>
					<td>8.5-10.2 mg/dL</td>
					<td>&lt;8.5 mg/dL</td>
					<td>Kidneys create Vitamin D which regulates the calcium levels in the blood. Therefore, lower calcium levels mean that the kidneys aren't creating proper amounts of Vitamin D.</td>
				</tr>

			<h2>Urinanalysis (not 24-hr)</h2>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Test</th>
					<th>Normal Range (for adults)</th>
					<th>Abnormal (for adults)</th>
					<th>Conclusion</th>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Protein</td>
					<td>0-14 mg/dL</td>
					<td>>14 mg/dL</td>
					<td>The protein in the urine is reflective of the albumin in the blood. When the kidneys aren't properly working, higher protein levels are exhibited in the urine and smaller levels of albumin are exhibited in the blood.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>White Blood Count (WBC)</td>
					<td>0-5 cells/hpf</td>
					<td>>5 cells/hpf</td>
					<td>A high white blood count infers that there is an infection in the urinary system or in another part of the body.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Red Blood Count (RBC)</td>
					<td>0-4 cells/hpf</td>
					<td>>4 cells/hpf</td>
					<td>If a higher amount of red blood cells are in the urine, this shows that there may be inflammation in the kidneys.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Epithelial Cells</td>
					<td>1-5 squamous epithelial cells/hpf</td>
					<td>>15 renal tubular epithelial cells/hpf</td>
					<td>If there is a large amount of squamous cells in the urine, it is likely that the sample was contaminated. If there are large amounts of renal cells, this could sugguet the kidneys aren't working correctly.</td>
